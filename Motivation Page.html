  <h1>App Brewery's Goal Setting Questions</h1>
  <h2>1. <em>Why</em> Do I want to Learn Web Development?</h2>
  <p><strong>What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove something to yourself or people around you? Will you get a raise because you’re better at your job or will you get a better job?</strong></p>
  <p>I want to learn coding for myself, because I find it fun. Because if I learn coding, I can pursue designing websites like I wanted to do when I was a kid, designing websites in microsoft word. This <i>may</i> or <i>may not</i> be something I want to
    pursue for a career path, and I will not put any pressure on myself to be The Best™ at it in order to make it a career. <em>If</em> I pursue it as a career path, I could make a great deal more money, and that would be nice, but not necessary.</p>

  <h2>2. What will I <em>acheive</em> if I learn Web Development?</h2>
  <p><strong>Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more, have more flexibility in your work hours, work remotely and travel more?</strong></p>
  <p>I will be able to design websites without frustration, and maybe pursue the "me" page that I came up with, for my portfolio, blog/webcomic/webpage thing, and personal information. <i>If</i> I choose to make it a career, I <i>might</i> find more
    fulfillment in it than what I am doing now, because I can work remotely, solve complex problems, put my creatives skills to use, work individually, and get better financial compensation.</p>

  <h2>3. How will this skill ​<em>change my life</em>​ and my career?</h2>
  <p><strong>Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once you’ve learnt this skill? Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?</strong></p>
  <p>I will be able to help those that come to be asking for web design services for real, instead of kinda just... not. And, I'll be able to say I can code!</p>
  <p>I suspect I'd be taking more commissions for website development. I <i>might</i> make a career out of this, and if I do, I would be working at a different place. Optionally, I could use it to help with Bytes of Business. Or Dynamic Service
    Group. There are so many possibilites.</p>


  <h2>4. How will learning this skill impact the ​<em>lives of my family</em>​, friends, and coworkers?</h2>
  <p><strong>What will you be able to do for your family or friends once you’ve learnt this skill? How will it change the way they think of you? Will your coworkers respect you more?</strong></p>
  <p>I will be able to help them with their website requests more deftly and quickly, and I suspect I'm going to be more respected as a Graphic Designer. And my mom will think I have a real job. That would be nice.</p>

  <h2>5. How will I <em>​feel</em>​ if I never accomplish this?</h2>
  <p><strong>Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?</strong></p>
  <p>I would feel... dissapointed. Frustrated. Angry with myself. I would probably have to fight the reinforcement of the idea that I never really work hard enough to do anything of value. That I'm just not <em>enough</em> to be successful at
    something I put my mind to.</p>


  <h2>6. What would <em>​my life</em>​ look like if I manage to accomplish this?</h2>
  <p><strong>Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? Will you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your handsome husband when you wake up?</strong></p>
  <p>Normally that's the easiest part for me, but for whatever reason, I'm struggling to dream about it. It just feels like the natural conclusion of some of the skills I already know.</p>
  <p>I guess... I can kind of visualize it, but all I can visualize are fears. That I'm just copying Miciah. That no matter how much time and effort I put into this, I'm never going to be as good as Miciah or Trenton. That nothing I do will fit
    together properly, and I'll be this sham-shackle pile of half-assed skills that have been poorly taped around with duct tape.</p>
  <p>Maybe I should have answered this question before #5.</p>
